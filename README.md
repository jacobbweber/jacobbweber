I am an IT Generalist and enjoy working with all aspects of technology. I am a problem solver and am always eager to take on new challenges. Most of my IT background has been centered around Windows Infrastructure Systems, Cisco UCS hardware, and VMware products from design, implementation, to support. But in my spare time, I still educate myself on other aspects of IT like Development, IT/Project Management, Infrastructure-as-code. I have been really passionate about automation and monitoring lately. If I find myself doing something more than once I try to automate it. And then setup some (meaningful) monitoring around that automation.

Some technologies/concepts I’m currently focusing on and having a lot of fun with:
- Terraform
- Ansible
- Gitlab
- Prometheus/Grafana
- Azure/Aws
- Linux based operating systems
- Containers/Kubernetes
- DevOps/Infrastructure-As-Code
- Rasberry PI/Robotics – I want to make a robotic fence line trimmer for livestock fences. Solar powered, lidar, gps assisted navigation. I live on a 5-acre hobby farm, so any opportunity I have to incorporate technology into my chores makes it fun.
